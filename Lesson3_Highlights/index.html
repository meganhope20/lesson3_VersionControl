            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Internet is one large network compiled of many different computer networks. The connection of these networks is worldwide, causing people to be able to communicate. Some of the elements that are brought together through the internet are a computer, a tablet, a smartphone, and the web server. The language that all devices use in order to communicate is called the Internet Protocol or IP. There are many different types of protocols for different requests that the internet needs to do. The main timeline of how the internet works is it starts will a website put into the browser, it then goes through the NAP and DNS server to identify it, once its found it connects to the WWW that is associated with it. It travels through the cloud to reach your server and then it appears on your screen..</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Every single device that is connected to the internet has its own IP address. The IP address is made up of dotted-decimal notation. The IP address has the capability to host multiple websites on one server. Sometimes, people can use the IP address of another device to look the person who is using it up or to see where the said device is located. There are some special cases where the internet service provider can not identify the person who is using the device because they have a higher security on it or the connection is not as strong.</p>

            <p class="lead">The network of the user is the base of the communications and the cloud represents everything outside of that. It performs inside the network and not inside the end-users network. The cloud has the ability to store a lot more than a computer itself can. Inside the cloud there are applications, platforms, and infrastructure. This is all separate from the devices and the servers.  Some examples of the cloud is email and Google Chrome browser. The both use minimal amount of software on the computer, it is all internal.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">HTML and HTTP</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">HyperText Transfer Protocol or HTTP is used to access websites where as  HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the language that create the webpages. The World Wide Web Consortium controls the rules of HTML on the internet. By using markers in HTML based on different stylistic desires you can to identify what the text should look like on the website. HTML is the the common language across all devices, so it is free for anyone to use and edit. HTTP allows for a more encrypted connection so that only the server and the person can see the actual DNS. HTTP is the main form of connection for the World Wide Web. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">DNS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Domain Name System is the web address that the user sees. Trying to have people remember IP addresses for every website is unrealistic, so making a DNS which connects the IP address to a simpler web name, makes it much easier to remember the address. When a person types in the name of a website that they want to visit the DNS then goes and searches their address book of IP addresses attached to that search to find the matching website. The 13 “root servers” connect all of IP addresses so that the DNS can search for the matching one easier. If using the same browser, often the DNS will remember what was previously searched and will have the ability to pull it up faster. Only when it can not remember or if it is a new search, does the DNS need to go to its 3 root servers to find the match.</p>
